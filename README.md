TODO:
- Solve 17/2 CPU conflict for IC,KWS and VWW.
- Run models on nRF52 in FLASH (ext pc) and RAM (local PC)
- 


DONE:
- Added benchmark implementation for Keyword Spotting (KWS)
- Added benchmark implementation for Visual Wake Words (VWW) 
- Include EnergyRunner dataset for running the benchmark
- 


Tensor area sizes for all the models;
- AD: 3
- IC: 54
- KWS : 23
- VWW : 100

- VWW 17/2 conflict solved by implementing model directly into main file submitter_implemented | idk why, but it works.
